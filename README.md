# Thrive-Rename-Json
A short python script to convert camelCase to PascalCase from the second layer onwards of a JSON file.

**Details**
First layer is avoided
Any single-letter variable names are avoided

**Issues**
Unable to loop through arrays in the JSON

**Instructions**
1. Navigate to file in terminal
2. Run ```py/python/python3 thrive_rename_json.py [folder_name] [file_to_update]```

*Will work as long as folder_name+file_name leads to file
